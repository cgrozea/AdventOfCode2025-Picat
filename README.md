# Solutions to [AdventOfCode2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) (AoC2025) using the language [Picat](https://picat-lang.org/) 

I try to publish those always the next day after the problem was proposed.

Given the nature of AoC, my solutions are not the most elegant, nor the fastest, just the fastest for me to write - also here they are as they passed the tests, but usually not cleaned up of debugging code or anything else that I needed to make it work.

Here a link to somebody else solving those with Picat and who spends the
time to comment his solutions: https://codeberg.org/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2025

Here the [Picat User Guide](https://picat-lang.org/download/picat_guide.pdf)
that I seem to need daily for those problems.
